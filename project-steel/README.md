# Steel temperature prediction

#### Task: 
- Build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel to minimize the production costs.

#### Description:
- In order to optimize production costs, a metallurgical plant decided to reduce electricity consumption at the stage of steel processing. You have to build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel based on the parameters of the purification process.

#### Status:
- Finished

#### Scope of Activities: 
- Production, Industry, Startups, Metallurgy

#### Used Libraries:
- Pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, LightGBM, CatBoost
