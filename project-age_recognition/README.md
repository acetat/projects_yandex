#### Task: 
- Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. At your disposal is a set of photographs of people with age indication.

#### Description:
- A supermarket chain introduces a computer vision system for processing customers' photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:

	- Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
	- Control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol.
