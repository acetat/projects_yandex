# Project description: Selection of a region for the development of new oil fields

## Data

The following data was available:
-quality of oil and the capacity of oil wells in three regions

## Problem
Decide in which region to produce oil. Build a machine learning model that would help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss.

## Results
- A model was built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells.
- The wells with the highest value estimates were selected.
- The regions with the maximum total revenue of the selected wells were determined.
- A model has been built to determine the region where mining will bring the highest profit. The possible profit and risks were analyzed with the Bootstrap technique.

## Libraries used
*pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, SciPy, scikit*
