# Selection of a region for the development of new oil fields

#### Task:  
- Decide in which region to extract oil. Build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss.


#### Description
- Based on the quality of oil and the capacity of oil wells in three regions a ML model was built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells. The wells with the highest value estimates were selected. The regions with the maximum total revenue of the selected wells were determined. A model has been built to determine the region where mining will bring the highest profit. The possible profit and risks were analyzed with the Bootstrap technique.
