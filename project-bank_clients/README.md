# Bank Churn Prediction

#### Task: 
- Analysis of the outflow of clients from the bank to select a strategy (retaining old clients or attracting new clients)

#### Description:
- Based on customer data (gender, location, salary level, etc.), the probability of the client leaving the bank in the near future was predicted. A model with an extremely large value of the F1-measure was built with subsequent verification on a test sample. The metric has been brought to 0.64. Additionally measured AUC-ROC, correlated with F1-measure.
