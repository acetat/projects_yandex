#### Task: 
- Choose the best model to determine the market value of the car.

#### Description:
- A used car selling site is developing an app to attract new customers. In the app, one can quickly find out the market value of their car. Based on historical data (technical characteristics, equipment, price) of cars a model has been built to determine the cost of a used car. Numerical methods, approximate calculations, algorithm complexity estimation, gradient descent were used.
